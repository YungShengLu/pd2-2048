2048
====

A C++/Qt clone of the popular 2048 game. 

Game logic is written in C++, the GUI in Qt 5.2.1. The entire GUI is written in code, Qt Creator's UI designer was not used.

The core is decoupled from the GUI using the observer pattern, so it is easy to pull the code, extract the core and then build a new GUI around it.
